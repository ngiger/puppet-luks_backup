h1. luks_backup module for Puppet

Puppet module for running encrypted backup via ssh to a Rasperry PI

h2. Examples

* To install the luks_backup:

    @class { 'luks_backup': }@

* Preparing an USB hard-disk for encrypted backups

Plug-in any suitable USB-hard disk. Running @dmesg | tail@ should give you an idea about the hard disk partition to use. 
We assume /dev/sda1 here. Run @/usr/local/bin/backup_encrypted.sh --device /dev/sda1@. This may take a long time (over an hour).
Many minutes will be needed to collect enough entropy to create the /etc/id.encryptd keyfile. $
Once this step is complete, you will be asked to confirm erasing the desired partition. Enter YES as prompted.
Formatting a the hard disk is also time consuming.

h2. Standalone use

As using Puppet to manage a rasperry PI might be an overkill there is helper script which installs the scripts into /usr/local/bin

h3. Prerequisites for standalone

bq. sudo aptitude install git cryptsetup ruby
git clone http://github.com/ngiger/puppet-luks_backup luks_backup
cd luks_backup
sudo ./install_into_user_local_bin
