h2. Graphische Oberfl√§che

After installing the program as described below you will can have a graphical interface which might include the following actions
!images/Overview.png!

* Mount the encrypted harddisk
* Unmount the encrypted harddisk
* Start the daily backup with default setting

After running "Mount encrypted HD" you may consult under /mnt/encrypted/snapshot the saved files. 0 denotes the most recent backup.


h3. Prerequisites

bc. sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get safe-upgrade
sudo apt-get install git util-linux cryptsetup ruby anacron rsnapshot
git clone https://github.com/ngiger/puppet-luks_backup luks_backup
cd luks_backup
sudo ./install_into_user_local_bin

h3. Prerequisites for standalone backup from remove server via ssh

We assume that we want to backup from a remote server using using the username backup via rsync and ssh.  backup@server.exampl.com.
We will use the root user to be able to run the backup in cron job.

bc. sudo ssh-keygen -f /etc/backup.ssh # Don't enter a passphrase
sudo ssh-copy-id backup@server.exampl.com # or copy the content of /etc/backup.ssh.pub to the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file
# sudo ssh -i /etc/backup.ssh -p 3333 niklaus@praxis.schoenbucher.ch 

You must also add a line "AllowUsers backup" to /etc/ssh/sshd_config.

h3. Preparing an USB hard-disk for encrypted backups

Plug-in any suitable USB-hard disk. Running @dmesg | tail@ should give you an idea about the hard disk partition to use.
We assume /dev/sda1 here. Run @/usr/local/bin/backup_encrypted.rb --init --device /dev/sda1@. This may take a long time (several hours).

Many minutes will be needed to collect enough entropy to create the /etc/id.encryptd keyfile. $
Once this step is complete, you will be asked to confirm erasing the desired partition. Enter YES as prompted.
Formatting the hard disk is also time consuming. Afterwards you should run the following commands @sudo chown root:backup /etc/backup.key && sudo chmod 0600 /etc/backup.key@

h3. Running the backup automatically

Using @sudo crontab -e@ add the following lines. Be aware that the interval is important. Also remark that after the last work (daily backup) we will shutdown the raspberry

bc. .50 23 * * * /usr/local/bin/run_encrypted_snapshot.rb /etc/rsnapshot.conf.prxserver daily --shutdown
40 23 * * 4 /usr/local/bin/run_encrypted_snapshot.rb /etc/rsnapshot.conf.prxserver weekly
30 23 1 * * /usr/local/bin/run_encrypted_snapshot.rb /etc/rsnapshot.conf.prxserver monthly
20 23 1 1 * /usr/local/bin/run_encrypted_snapshot.rb /etc/rsnapshot.conf.prxserver yearly

h3. Checking

In the file @/var/log/rsnapshot.log@ you will find the log of all backups.

install rsnapshot
/home/samba
/backup/postgresql/

h3. Security

* Change the password of the default Rasbian user pi (@sudo passwd pi@) or delete it (@sudo deluser pi@)
* Add a new user (@adduser myUserName@)
* Change /etc/sshd_config zu include
# AllowUsers myUserName anotherUserName
# PermitRootLogin no
